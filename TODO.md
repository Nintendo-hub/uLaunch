# uLaunch's TODO list

- Improve QDaemons's IPC with two services, one only for QMenu and the other one for any process to interact with uLaunch:

  - Easy way to detect whether uLaunch is present

  - Get whether a title/homebrew is opened

- (check suggestions and bugs in issues for user-submitted TODOs)
